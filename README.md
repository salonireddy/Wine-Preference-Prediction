# Wine-Preference-Prediction
For this project we will start with a general idea of the wine consumption throughout the world, including dataset analysis. A general description and exploratory analysis of the dataset will be presented which will be followed by the application of Decision Trees and Random Forests to perform prediction and correlation analysis. In addition, it compares the accuracy of both the models to suggest a better model for analysis and prediction of wine quality and thus improve the robustness of the proposed model. For predicting values of new data points, the model uses ‘correlation’, assigning a new point to values based on how close it resembles the points on the training set. The idea of this study is illustrating the different forecasting tools, comparing them, and analyzing the behavior of predictions.
